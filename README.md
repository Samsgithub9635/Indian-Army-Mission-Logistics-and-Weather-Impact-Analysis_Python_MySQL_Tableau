# Indian Army Mission Logistics and Weather Impact Analysis Using Python + MySQL + Tableau

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Indian Army Mission Logistics and Weather Impact Analysis** is a data analytics project focused on improving the **logistics and supply chain efficiency** of the Indian Army, especially in **difficult terrains like Ladakh**.  
By analyzing transport missions, weather conditions, and drone/mule operational data, the project aims to **identify delays, optimize critical supply missions**, and **enhance operational readiness**.

Due to national security and confidentiality, **dummy data** has been generated to simulate real-world logistics operations.

## 📦 Tech Stack Used
- **Python (Pandas)** — Exploratory Data Analysis
- **MySQL** — Database creation, management and to run quries and find insights
- **HTML, CSS & JavaScript** — Interactive dashboard visualization

---

## 📊 Key Features
- Analyze **logistics mission success rates** by transport mode.
- Identify **critical reasons for delays** (weather, mechanical, operational).
- Correlate **weather conditions** with **mission delays**.
- Evaluate **drone vs robotic mule performance** under different terrains and conditions.
- Suggest **data-driven improvements** for faster, safer supply chain operations.
- Real-time dashboard insights for strategic planning.

## 📚 Data Description
> **Important Note**:  
The datasets used in this project are **dummy data** created to mirror real-world army logistics scenarios.  
Original Indian Army logistics and weather data could not be used due to **confidentiality and national security reasons**.

| Dataset | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `logistics.csv` | Logistics missions data: sources, destinations, modes, status |
| `weather.csv` | Daily weather conditions at Ladakh bases and posts |
| `drone_ops.csv` | Drone and Robotic Mule delivery operational statistics |

## 🧠 Insights Derived
Extreme weather (heavy snowfall, low visibility) significantly delays drone deliveries.

Robotic mules show better consistency but slower delivery rates.

Critical supplies often face disproportionate delays requiring urgent rescheduling based on weather forecasts.

Data-driven decision making can dramatically improve mission success rates in remote sectors.

## ✍️ Future Enhancements
Integrate real-time weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for live scheduling.

Build a predictive delay model using Machine Learning.

Expand datasets to cover other terrains like Siachen, Arunachal Pradesh.

## 🇮🇳 Motivation
The Indian Army stands as a pillar of strength and protection for every Indian.
Through this project, I aim to use my skills to contribute to enhancing operational excellence and ensuring the safety of soldiers and citizens alike.
